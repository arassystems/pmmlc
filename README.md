# Predictive Maintenance Machine Learning Challenge

## About ARAS Systems GmbH & Co. KG

We would like to give committed talents worldwide the opportunity to prove themselves in the area of machine learning and predictive maintenance. Before you start the challenge, please register with mlchallenge@arassystems.de.

ARAS Systems GmbH & Co. KG is a technology company offering development services in the field of industrial automation. Among other things, we develop software for industrial control systems and embedded systems. Besides programming software for control systems ARAS Systems GmbH & Co. KG also develops solutions in the area of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this challenge is in the area of predictive maintenance for production machines. 

## Introduction to the machine learning challenge


That's why we want to give this challenge a chance to challenge machine learning enthusiasts from all over the world. Naturally, the winner will be rewarded with attractive prizes - please get in contact with us explicitly. Depending on your background we offer different prices.

To task description:
Machine data are, for example, log values ​​of sensors and actuators. These values ​​can be temperature, pressure, voltage, current, etc. Since we are not allowed to load this data into the Challenge for confidentiality reasons, we will use NASA aircraft turbine data.

In the end, these turbine data are similar to machine data. Because similar to industrial production plants aircraft turbines have different states. A newly started turbine has a different temperature value than a turbine that has been in use for 10 hours. A turbine in Russia has a different temperature level than a similar turbine in Singapore under high humidity conditions.

The first step in this challenge is to design a machine learning model that learns the normal behavior of each turbine and detects the anomaly. Here, the remaining life of the engine is to be found out.
In the second step, the data without motor designation should be read in and clustered. The clustering should learn different normal states and derive anomalies from them.
